## Website Features

The idea behind the site was to be able to track a person's location, and based on their favorite foods, decide where they should eat.

Users are able to:

- Without an account, be able to choose a random dinner from the home screen based on their current location
- sign up and log in with full authentication and password hashing
- edit username/password and delete user profile
- Add and change a user's favorite foods (up to 6 - 3 food categories for each person)
- Activate the Ateball which magically decides where a person should eat based on their location and food choices

Future features we'd like to implement:

- fully mobile responsiveness
- implementation with React Native and the ability to download from the app store/android market
